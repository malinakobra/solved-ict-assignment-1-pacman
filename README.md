The purpose of this assignment is to construct and document a Requirements Specification, Design, and Development Process for a classic computer game Pac-Man. You should apply, as far as possible, the software engineering techniques introduced in this course. You should employ an OO design and demonstrate capability to use advanced design patterns and tactics in your project. The following problem statement is provided. The assignment is to be conducted in groups with no more than four students in one group.

<h1>Problem Definition</h1>

Pac-Man is a classic maze action game developed and released by Namco in 1980. Please study the Wikipedia page of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-Man">Pac-Man – Wikipedia</a> for the detailed introduction of this game. You are asked to reproduce this game for computers of different platforms. All important features in the original game should be included in your design and development (please check the marking criteria for important features must be implemented in your game).

Apart from the requirements from the original game, your program should have a start up page, the start up page should contain:

<ol>

 <li>The title and logo of Pac-Man</li>

 <li>The year and course code</li>

 <li>The list of all students in your group</li>

 <li>An exit button</li>

 <li>A configure button. In the configure page, a player can select normal predefined maze and randomly generated mazes.</li>

 <li>A play button to take the player to the game</li>

</ol>

<strong><u>Guidance</u></strong>




<u>The emphasis of the assignment is upon the use of best software engineering practices to produce high</u> <u>quality software products. The assignment has two stage submissions with 15% weight each in the final</u> <u>grade</u>.




<ol>

 <li>At the outset of the assignment you should create a plan which documents in tabular form, when you expect to complete each phase of the development process. This should include the time/date when you expect to complete the development, verification and correction of the product produced in each phase. You should also include the number of person hours that you expect to spend on each activity. Later, when each phase is completed you should record the actual time taken and when the task was completed. There should also be documentation which shows which team members were responsible for each task</li>
